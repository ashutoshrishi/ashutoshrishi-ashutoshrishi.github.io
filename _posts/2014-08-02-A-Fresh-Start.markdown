I have just begin my graduate coursework in Masters of Science, Computer Science in the University
of Melbourne (Australia). It's a great environment with a plethora of resources. Now it's just what you can
make of them.

Most of my projects have been with my undergraduate University (official and student associations),
personal projects inspired during the process of learning new technologies, big (but still solo)
undertakings with just a beginning and no continuation and websites designed and not used. This blog
is another iteration of designs which I run and then soon end up changing. I have been running through
blog designs so fast that I have even outpaced my writing. This, stabilizes with the current iteration.

The usual trend is to import some of my older posts (selected by quality, which is just in fact a metric
referring to the length of the post). Seeing how I am trying to break away from my usual behavior, I won't
that. Instead, it's all newer posts, with newer ideas and more tuned experience by age. I would put out views,
project ideas and implementations and guides for certain things I have had to figure out for myself, which can
hopefully benefit some random person. After all, guides and tutorials on solving tiny quirks is the first entry
point to a new blog.

Of course, the point and focus of this blog is to generate brand. Self branding will be a useful tool to find
some freelancing job (since `ledger` has looked over my `ledger.org` determined future scantiness). This is also
mostly the final draft of a logo for me, which I have been sketching on notebooks since forever.

My new beginning in Melbourne has been turning out great so far, verified by the sudden growth and organization
of my `evilplans.org` file.

A short overview on how I built this blog (obligatory):
I have used [Jekyll][1] to generate static files for [Github Pages][2].
Also [Bootstrap][3] [LESS][4] files compiled alongside my own. LESS is so awesome.
