Specially because you can just upload it into Github pages. And it's
free. I will need to customize the workflow. The 12$ wasted on the potato
Chicago VPS can be used here to run a cron job, to update the posts in the
repository by reading dropbox. Also, Ruby, is turning out to be attractive.

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build
(or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!  To add new posts, simply add
a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention:
YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %} def print_hi(name) puts "Hi, #{name}" end print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.  {% endhighlight %}
